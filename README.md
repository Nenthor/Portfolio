# Portfolio

This project uses Astro to generate a static website.
You can visit my portfolio website under [nentwich.dev](https://nentwich.dev/)

## How to run the project

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm build`
4. Serve static content from `dist` directory. I am using [nginx](https://nginx.org/) for this.

Thanks for visiting my portfolio! Have a great day! ^^
